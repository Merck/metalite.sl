</h2>
<p>metalite.sl R package designed for the analysis &amp; reporting of
subject-level analysis in clinical trials. It operates on ADaM datasets
and adheres to the metalite structure. The package encompasses the
following components:</p>
<details><summary>
Baseline Characteristics.
</summary><img src="https://merck.github.io/metalite.sl/articles/fig/base0char.png" width="100%"></details><p>This R package offers a comprehensive software development lifecycle
(SDLC) solution, encompassing activities such as definition,
development, validation, and finalization of the analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="highlighted-features">Highlighted features<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#highlighted-features"></a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid duplicated input by using metadata structure.
<ul>
<li>For example, define analysis population once to use in all subject
level analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consistent input and output in standard functions.</li>
<li>Provide workflow to add interactive features to subject-level
analysis table.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#workflow"></a>
</h2>
<p>The overall workflow includes the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define metadata information using metalite R package.</li>
<li>Prepare outdata using <code>prepare_*()</code> functions.</li>
<li>Extend outdata using <code>extend_*()</code> functions
(optional).</li>
<li>Format outdata using <code>format_*()</code> functions.</li>
<li>Create TLFs using <code>tlf_*()</code> functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, we can illustrate the creation of a straightforward
Baseline characteristic table as shown below.</p>
